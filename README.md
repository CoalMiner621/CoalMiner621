My thoughts on creating a trading platform that can use MT4 and MT5 indicators as mode menu
a editor wisward for the mode menu MT5 & MT4 FOR EA ADVISOR/ INDICATORS OR WISWARD COMPATIPLE WITH MT4 AND MT5

SCREEN BACKROUND CAN BE MOVED AROUND AT WILL ALSO INSTALL JPG, BMP, PNG, BACKROUND 

STOP LIMIT & BUY STOP VICEVERSA WITH OCO; USING TRENLINE CLICK MENU:  RISK AND REWARD RATIO INCASE THE TREND REVERSE IN A BREAKOUT

SUCH AS FLAT, SIDWAYS, CONGESTION IN ADDITION WHEN SUCH OCCERANCE IT CAN BE REVERSE WITHOUT PENALTY

USING DATA FEED FREE TO GIVE THE USER REAL TIME TRADING AND USING DIFFRENT TIME FRAME  10 MIN 20 MIN 45 MIN 2HR 4HR D1 

MANUEL, SEMI AUTO, AUTO TRADING     AS YOU STATED USING CANDLE TIMER  WOULD BE GOOD TO USE AN AI IF POSSIBLE.  

LAST TO NOTE:  AND MAYBE USE THE SESSIONS WITH THE AI TO GIVE THE SIGNALS FOR THE SESSIONS BRAKEOUT

EXTREME, STRONG, NETURAL MEANING NO TRADE, WEAK TRADE, ALSO CREATING SETIMENT AND CORRELATION HEAT MAP FOR SEMI AUTO TRADING.  

THIS IS BASED ON DIFFERENT TRADING PLATFORMS I OBSERVERD OVER TIME.  ALL ARE GOOD BUT DIFFERENT FROM EACK OTHER

I SEE THIS AS ONE STOP SHOP TRADING PLATFORM AND IF THE USER WISHES CREATE THEIR OWN CASE STUDIES.  

MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM TO USE ANY MT4 OR MT5 BROKER LOGIN.     LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK !
